# PRODIGY_DS_01

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I created a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this task is World Population dataset. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

## Tools and Libraries used:
1) Jupyter notebook 
2) Pandas 
3) Numpy 
4) Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

During the Visualization process, I performed the following steps:

### Data Cleaning:
Checked for missing values, duplicates in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

### Visualization: 
Created a bar chart to visualize the distribution of the population in terms of total, male, and female counts.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this visualization process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

### Thank you for reviewing my submission!
